This directory contain a data set prepared for the use of participants
for the 1994 AAAI Spring Symposium on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.

* diabetes-data.tar.Z contains the distribution for 70 sets of data recorded
on diabetes patients (several weeks' to months' worth of glucose, insulin,
and lifestyle data per patient + a description of the problem domain).
Archived using tar and compressed.

Extract the data files from the archive.  On a Unix system, type
'tar xvf icu-data.tar'.  This will create a new directory named  ICU-Data
and extract all data files into that directory.  Very occasionally
this may not work; in that case try 'tar xvof' instead of 'tar xvf'.
